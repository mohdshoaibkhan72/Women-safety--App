            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                This study introduces a safety app for women, focusing on using Bluetooth to enhance security. The app, designed for smartphones, connects with a Bluetooth device. If the connection is lost, it sends a distress message to the user’s parents immediately, ensuring prompt assistance. The research explains the app’s functionality, setup, and response in case of a problem. It emphasizes the importance of such apps for women’s safety, providing peace of mind and swift help in emergencies. The paper discusses potential improvements and the broader societal impact, highlighting technology’s crucial role in enhancing women’s safety and addressing safety concerns through innovation.
